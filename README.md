# cdsw-engine-custom-01
This branch of the repository contains the docker file to build a custom image for CDSW including CAPS (Cypher on Apache Spark).

This is supplementary material for a blog post ... (under construction).

The example dataset we use here is the GLEIF data. We download the "concatenated files" into our workspace for HDFS upload.
